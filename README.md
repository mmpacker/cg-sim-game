# 'Happy Cow': a Cow Grazing Simulator
### by Matt Packer

## About *Happy Cow*:

This is an exercise in which I was challenged to develop an application that simulates a cow grazing a field of lush, delicious grass. I have adapted it to be a game that challenges the player to eat 10 patches of grass before their time is up.

This application uses HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

In order to develop this game, I researched several 2D grid-based games that were developed using JavaScript or Python. Many of the examples I found were variants of the classic game 'Snake'. I ended up using the mechanics of the 'Snake' games as the basis for developing *Happy Cow*.

I hope you enjoy playing my game!


## Getting Started:

*Happy Cow* was deployed using Surge, and can be launched here: [LAUNCH HAPPY COW](www.google.com).

##### How to Play:

1. Press the 'START' button to begin the game.
2. Use the arrow keys to move the cow on the playing field.
3. Eat the grass as it appears around the playing field.
4. Eat 10 patches of grass within 60 seconds to win!



## Technical Summary:

* JavaScript
* HTML
* CSS
* Git
* GitHub
* Surge



## Icebox Features (Future Enhancements):

* Enhance style to ensure accessibility for all users.
* Make the entire app 100% responsive by adding media queries and fluid layouts.
* Use another library or technology like Canvas, Phaser, or SVG to enhance the game design.
* Add an additional challenge by including a game element that can cause damage to the cow (i.e. a snake, or a bird, etc.).
